## Yo, world 👋

I am a software engineer in training. Specializing in back-end development, but having as an objective to become one day a full stack developer. I specialize in JAVA, but am also open to other programming languages such as Go and C#. 

🎯 I truly believe that once we develop well our logical thinkng, understand how the code is executed and we learn the good practices concerning a clean, simple as possible, readable and well structured code, changing technologies is not scary. 

💡 I'm currently looking forward to completing my courses and starting an internship as a back-end/full stack apprentice.
